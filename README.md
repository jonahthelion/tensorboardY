# tensorboardY
The easier it is to interact with ML models, the faster we'll be able to figure out their current limitations. The goal of this library is to make it as easy as possible to build demo websites for ML.

This library seeks to automate the creation of ML demo websites like

* [Megadepth](http://megadepthdemo.pythonanywhere.com/)
* [Talk to transformer](https://talktotransformer.com/?ref=producthunt)
* [GLTR](http://gltr.io/dist/index.html)
* [Wayve demo](http://perception.wayve.ai/)
* [FUNIT](https://nvlabs.github.io/FUNIT/petswap.html)
